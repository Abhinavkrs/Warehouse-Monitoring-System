The monitoring system will be attached in the confined box. The whole warehouse will be changed into
series of shelves with confined boxes. All the fruits and vegetable will be segregated and kept at places
accordingly. Threshold values for all the sensors will be fixed from the test case analysis. This will play a
very important in creating of emergency system for the monitoring.

All the sensors will be interfaced to microcontroller. At the entry of the warehouse, EM18 will be fitted
which will act as security system at the entrance. For a person to enter the warehouse, needs an identity
card which if matches with a permitted individual database, allows that person in warehouse.
Inside the warehouse, all the fruits and vegetable are arranged according to certain criteria. The person can
directly go the desired point for any fruit or vegetable.

When there is no one in the warehouse, the smart monitoring keeps working. The different sensors like
humidity sensor, temperature sensor and smoke sensor keeps monitoring the condition of the stored items.
PIR sensors are fitted at square area to keeping checking if any animals or any other unwanted intruder
comes near the supply storage.

If the sensor value crosses any threshold, primarily sensors itself control the situation and if the level
touches serious point, then emergency messages are sent. GSM module is also fitted at each warehouse.
Whenever it receives any alarming signal from any sensor, it sends a predefined message to the appointed
authority.
